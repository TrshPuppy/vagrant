# Vagrant VM Environment
This repo is dedicated to Hashimoto and the spirit of automation!

## The Problem(s):
I suddenly needed so many VMs!
- WSL is toxic for coding and building cross-platform Electron apps
- [PNPT](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/PNPT-study-guide) requires a kali VM for ethical hacking
- I'd like to start dabbling in [malware reverse engineering](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/PMAT-study-guide/tree/1fee3f22a5b61bb473f0eefe0b7191fcdbe3a738)
- & I'm tired of [Hack the Box's](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1343592) Pwn Box

## The Solution:
I decided to learn [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs)
